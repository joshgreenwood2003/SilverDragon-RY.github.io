Interest of content- Very good:

Very interesting and unique topic to choose. Also a very relevant and recent example

Consistency and quality of visual presentation- Sound:

Inconsistent fonts used between the image text and website text. Visual difference between the 2 webpages. However a blue theme is used throughout

Quality of written presentation- Good:

Good quality of information, moderately easy to understand. However seems to be mostly copied/ only slightly modified from scientific american without any proper referencing

Validity of HTML- Sound:

HTML is mostly valid however lots of clutter- unused stylesheet and script, unorganised HTML file. However style has been properly moved to a stylesheet and linked, as well as the images. Used old tags which are no longer supported. HTML webpages are not linked together- to read the pages you have to click on the html files in the folder manually.

Evidence of collaboration- N/A:

Good management of website for someone working by themselves- a much larger workload to deal with
